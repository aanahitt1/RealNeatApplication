     //and therefore must find another way to sequentially access the data.
     //we can probably do this like
     QJsonArray arr = var.toJsonArray();
     //but arr still doesn't know what's inside it because... well it has no way of knowing.
     //Therefore
     arr[0].value("pass");
     //is incomprehensible to the compiler.
     //Options:
     //Follow this rabbit hole all the way to the end. Maybe using <T> to calm the frayed nerves of the compiler.
     //2 Arrays inside the json, 1 for the command which we have to keep track of, and 1 for the String,double pair
     //We can maybe iterate through QVariant? QVariant::value<type> can be accessed this way. This was what I was doing when I 'lost' the previous file.
     //There are methods QVariant::canConvert(), and many options for converting QVariants into specific types so we can do things with them. Brute force-y.
